This script loads a dataset into a Pandas Data Frame. This is used by the Microsoft tool, Power BI Desktop, 
to import the data using their Python Script Data Source. It can be refreshed using their UI's after the
project has already been created. 

Note: as of December 31 there is a bug in numpy on windows that PowerBI encounters. You must use numpy version 
1.19.3
